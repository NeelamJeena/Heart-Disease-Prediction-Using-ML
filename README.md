# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-ML

Machine learning is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. It gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect. We probably use a learning algorithm dozens of time without even knowing it.
In medical science, machine learning is used for diseases diagnoses. With this, medical technology is growing very fast and able to build 3D models that can predict the diseases like diabetes  and heart diseases beforehand.
